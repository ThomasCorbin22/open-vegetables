Open Vegetables

How to divide labour:

1 person front-end
1 person back-end
1 person linking between front end and back end. Full stack engineer who is happy with both front end and back end

For example:

Restaurant Router
User Router

Needs to be able to book tables (make an api and send an email to the restaurants)
Do we let the restaurants update their own page? Or control it inhouse
blogs / news / events

Postgres Table
Admin
Users - favourite restaurants, blog posts
Restaurants - need photos, menus
Reviews - 

log-in functionality. What can they do?

put images into firebase

Tracking on a map

What to do now?
	
	Search for restaurants
	Geolocation server
	Handlebars
	Today think about the functionalities, and specification. Do database design over the weekend	

Wireframe - Outlook, what it looks like and the information that is on each page. So I can scrape correct data and we can design database properly.
Specification - Listing out the functionalities and the methods to do them. 
Database Design - Resolved after both of these things as it needs to store everything from functions / front end.
